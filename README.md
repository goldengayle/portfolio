# Portfolio (Challenge #2)
## Description
This project is a landing page for my future developer portfolio. The project gave me an opportunity to practice creating a website with HTML and CSS, specifically considering how to use flexbox and media queries to have a site responsive to screen readers and different sized screens. This portfolio site currently uses knitting images as placeholders for future development projects.

## Usage
AS A USER I want to find out if Gayle is a good fit for my organization.
